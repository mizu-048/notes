# Moeed ka kaam:
## Uses:
- Due to its small size and slow speed, the UAV would be best used for 
	- detailed area mapping
	- high precision monitoring 
	- visual inspection infrastructure 
Due to the restriction on fixed-wing UAV, we our model will be designed to be in large area mapping due to its efficiency and endurance.

its meant to fly at speeds of 10 to 20 m/s and should be about 0.25 kg to 2.0 kg due to the limited size
although our main concern is not the weight but rather the design and finishing of the final model

The UAV's specifications place it firmly in the **"Mini/Small" Fixed-Wing Category** for professional use, characterized by:

- **Hand Launch:** Its size allows for easy, hand-toss launch, eliminating the need for a runway or catapult.
    
- **Energy Efficiency:** As a fixed-wing design, it is more efficient than a multi-rotor of similar size, allowing for longer flight times (typically 60-120 minutes) essential for mapping and surveillance missions.
    
- **Low Cost/Portability:** Its small dimensions (Wingspan ≈0.61 m) make it extremely portable and less expensive than large, industrial UAVs (which often have wingspans over 2 meters and MTOWs over 5 kg).
