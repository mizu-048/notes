- **Category:** A4 
	- Single-Stage Rocket
	- COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) Solid Propellant Rocket Motor
	- Goal: to Reach the Highest Altitude
- Min 4 and Max 6 members at assembly/firing range
- 100 points if half or more members brought to Aksaray Hisar Firing Range are females
- Aside from reaching minimum of 8000ft, we must also be within $\pm 15\%$ tolerance of our declared(predicted) altitude, which we will submit after assembly at their firing range
- Minimum of $85\%$ score is required in each stage to be considered for the next stage.
- Other than the minimum a threshold will be set based on how many teams should go into the next stage
- Teams advancing to next stage will be
$$
\begin{align}
 \text{PDR} \xrightarrow{13  \text{ teams}} &   \text{CDR} \\
 \text{CDR} \xrightarrow{8  \text{ teams}}  &  \text{LRR} \\
 \text{LRR} \xrightarrow{6  \text{ teams}}  &  \text{Finalist} \\
\end{align}
$$
- and the number of participating teams in 2025 was: 1175
- We can object their evaluation at max twice in each stage
- Atleast 1 advisor per team (Teachers, academicians, instructors, and members of teams that have previously won the right to launch a rocket in any rocket competition (provided they are over 18 years of age) can participate as advisors)
- Members can added or removed until the CDR submission date




- maximum 2 second delay between apogee/nose down orientation and primary parachute deployment
- 400-600 meters (1,312 to 1,969ft) range above ground, for secondary parachute deployment 
- ![operation concept.png|600](/img/user/TeknoFest/attachments/operation%20concept.png)
- Motor to be provided at range is Aerotech M1850 motor
- separate tracking system for both rocket and payload
- Altimeter will be provided on assembly day by teknofest
- payload should be a minimum of 4kg
