>[!tldr] Communication/Connection Crisis
> > [!NOTE] Slide
> > >_“Listen with curiosity. The greatest problem with communication is we don’t listen to understand. We listen to reply. When we listen with curiosity, we don’t listen with the intent to reply. We listen for what’s behind the words.” _
> > > Roy T. Bennett, _The Light in the Heart_

> > [!NOTE] Speech
> > - In this modern day and age, the world has become more connected than ever
> > - Yet even in this utopia of instant communication, the people have become more distant than ever. This isn't just due to the constant distractions of technological wonders that we keep in our pockets, its largely attributed to the fact that most of us are incapable of listening.
> > - Majority of the human conflicts exist because people are unwilling to "listen" to others opinion.
> > - It is the core nature of man to want their feelings known and express themselves.


>[!tldr]  Yearning to be understood
> > [!NOTE] Slide
> > - What it feels like to not being heard: (show points one by one) (ask a student)
> > 	- you feel invisible
> > 	- you feel insignificant
> > 	- you feel unwelcomed

> > [!NOTE] Speech
> > - In a commute, you don't just give your opinion, you also take someone else's and that's not just for your future benefit. You listen to provide the other person an opportunity to present their ideas and share their experiences. You don't just listen to gain, But you also listen to give. The speaking party expects of you understand them, to empathize with them


>[!tldr]  Empathy 
> > [!NOTE] Slide
> > - Manim slide with empathy -> good listener
>
> > [!NOTE] Speech
> > - Empathy, is the quality of understanding and sharing someone's feelings
> > - It very easily creates a mutual bond between two people
> > - Empathy in a person can work wonders in their social life, it is this quality that makes you someone's good friend or lack of it, their annoying acquaintance
> > - You might have experienced it yourself where you just connect with someone on a topic, that you both are enthusiastic about



>[!tldr]  Science of listening

> > [!NOTE] Speech
> > - Active listening isn't something you are just born with, its a skill that has to be developed, this belief is further solidified by science. Due to the biology of our brains and how they interpret meaning from sentences it does come to us by nature to listen actively
> >   
> > - An average person speaks at around 150 Words per minutes (WPM). These values of course vary from person to person and  like I have a habit of speaking fast, while other, being aware of social etiquettes talk in a more appropriate speed. Anyway, being the biological wonders that we are, we can process spoken words and thoughts at the rate of 600 to more than 800 words per minute!!, that's a difference of atleast 400 words per minute
> > - Now this gap of information being conveyed and received  is where our brains drift into other imaginative matters or worldly problems
> > - Secondly the auditory cortex of brains, has a filter, no not your snapchat filters, an actual filter that remove unnecessary noise from the background
> > - Third thing is memory, despite being faster at registering what is said, remembering all of it is hard, we often only remember certain ideas or key phrases from a commute, and even those are from ones  
> > - Aside from just being faster at processing verbal queues, our brains are excellent at predicting the message being conveyed. Which further adds to the urge to drift away
