> > - Active listening isn't something you are just born with, its a skill that has to be developed, this belief is further solidified by science. Due to the biology of our brains and how they interpret meaning from sentences it doesn't come to us by nature to listen actively

These values of course vary from person to person and  like I have a habit of speaking fast, while other, being aware of social etiquettes talk in a more appropriate speed. Anyway, being the biological wonders that we are, we can process spoken words and thoughts at the rate of 600 to more than 800 words per minute!!, that's a difference of atleast 400 words per minute
