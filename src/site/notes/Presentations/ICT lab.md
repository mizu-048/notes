- why collections library:
	- For deque data structure
		- **Deque:** a versatile linear data(1 dimensional) structure that allows for the efficient insertion and deletion of elements from both its front and rear ends
	- its more efficient at list handling
-  the MOG2 algorithm for background subtraction also detects shadows which are highlighted grey in this demo
	- we used MOG2 instead of KNN algorithm for background subtraction because it is faster and more memory efficient
	- other alternative algorithms like GMG, CNT, MOG
